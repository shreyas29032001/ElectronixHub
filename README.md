## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get ElectronixHub up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher**
* **Maven 3.6.x or higher**
* **Node.js 18.x or higher**
* **npm 9.x or higher (comes with Node.js)**
* **Angular CLI (install globally):**

    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```
* **A database:** H2 (in-memory, default for quick start), or MySQL.

### Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Backend/ElectronixHub-SpringBoot
    ```
2.  **Configure Database (for persistent data with MySQL):**
    First, ensure you have the MySQL JDBC driver dependency in your `pom.xml` (located in `Backend/ElectronixHub-SpringBoot/pom.xml`):

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
        <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
        <version>8.0.33</version> </dependency>
    ```
    Then, modify `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your MySQL database details:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ElectronixHub_db?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
    spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # or create, create-drop (use 'update' for existing schema, 'create' for new)
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
    ```
    **Important:**
    * Replace `your_mysql_username` and `your_mysql_password` with your actual MySQL credentials.
    * Ensure a database named `ElectronixHub_db` (or whatever you choose) exists in your MySQL server. You might need to create it manually: `CREATE DATABASE ElectronixHub_db;`
    * Set `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` to `update` (recommended after initial setup) or `create` if you want Hibernate to generate the schema for you on startup. Be cautious with `create` as it drops and recreates tables, leading to data loss.

3.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
4.  **Run the Spring Boot application:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`.
### Frontend Setup (Angular)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Frontend/ElectronixHub-Angular
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the Angular development server:**
    ```bash
    ng serve --open
    ```
    The Angular application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.

    * **Default Admin Credentials:**

        * **Password:** `admin` (We need to give in cd Backend/ElectronixHub-SpringBoot/ElectronixHubController.java as default credentials)
* **Admin Dashboard:** After logging in, we'll be redirected to `/admin-home` where we can view registered users.
* **Manage Products:** Navigate to `/admin-products` to add, edit, or delete products.
